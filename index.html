        <h2>What is TimeChampions</h2>
        <p>TimeChampions is a fun and challenging top down view racing game
            <br>made as the final assignment for the minor 'Creative Design & Technology'
            <br>at the Saxion university of applied sciences.

        <h2>Why did I create this game</h2>

        <p>This minor differs a lot from my main study, which is Automotive Engineering.
            <br>To challenge myself and explore my creative side I dicided that trying to
            <br>make a video game and all the visuals for it was a good and challenging
            <br>way to test my skills and knowledge. I did however want to keep some connection
            <br>with my main study, which is way I decided to create a racing game.

        <p>To create my game I decided to use Gamemaker Studio 2. This engine is a great
            <br>beginner friendly tool for creating 2D games. It has great support which allowed
            <br>me to find all the help I needed.

        <h2>Krita</h2>
        <img src="Krita logo.png" alt="Krita logo" width="256" height="256">

        <p>To create the visuals for my game I decided to use Krita. This tool is an Image
            <br>manipulation program. As the name implies it allows for image manipulation
            <br>but additionally it is also a painting program. This combination of features
            <br>allowed me to create the cars in the game, which are based on real cars.    
        </p>

        <p>The playable cars above from left to right are: "Volkswagen Golf", "Peugeot 309",
            <br>"Audi 80", "Citroen BX", "Renault 5" and "Volvo 240". These cars are created by
            <br>loading a top down image of the cars into Krita, scaling them down and then
            <br>tracing them. After that it is as simple as filling them in and shading them.

        <h2>How I created TimeChampions</h2>
        <p>The following images will show some of the code behind TimeChampions
            <br>and explain some of the innerworkings of the game.
        </p>

        <h3>Cars</h3>

        <p>All the cars in the game use the same code to control them. the images below show this code.
            <br>the accelerating and decelerating is done simply by checking if the up arrow is pressed.
            <br>If it is then the car accelerates, if it is not then the car decelerates.
            <br>If the down arrow is pressed then the car decelerates a bit more quickly.
            <br>The turning is limited by speed. The faster the player is driving the slower the car turns.     
        </p>

        </div>

        <h3>Car selection</h3>

        <p>The car selection is simply done by creating clickable objects out of the playable cars.
            <br>All cars have a global variable which can either be true or false. Depending on what
            <br>car the player clicks on, the corresponding variable will be turned to true indicating
            <br>that this car is selected. This will also move the car forward slighly, turn all the
            <br>other variables to false and change the image that displays the statistics of the car.  
        </p>

        </div>

        <h3>Collisions</h3>
        
        <p>The collisions with the trackborders are done by checking if the used car and the collisionmasks
            <br>are overlapping. If they are than the speed of the car is reduced to two, and the car is 
            <br>pushed back a couple pixels in the opposite direction that the car is hitting the mask with.
            <br>This ensures that the car does not get stuck in the trackborders.
        </p>

        <img src="collisions.png" alt="collisions">

        <h3>Timers</h3>

        <p>To time the player on track and time the countdowns, multiple timers are present in the game.
            <br>The main one being the start timer. This timer takes care of starting the game, starting the
            <br>timing system and limiting the players movements.
            <br>The start timer is started every time a track room is loaded. Its starts running down its first
            <br>alarm which times the coundown display. Once this alarm has reached zero it will free up the players
            <br>movement and allows the second alarm to be started. This alarm is started if the player drives over 
            <br>the trigger and stopped if the player crosses it again. Once the timer is stopped the finish display
            <br>is shown and the controls are taken away from the player once again.
