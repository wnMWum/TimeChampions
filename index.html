        <h2>What is TimeChampions</h2>
        <p>TimeChampions is a fun and challenging top down view racing game
            <br>made as the final assignment for the minor 'Creative Design & Technology'
            <br>at the Saxion university of applied sciences.

        <h2>Why did I create this game</h2>

        <p>This minor differs a lot from my main study, which is Automotive Engineering.
            <br>To challenge myself and explore my creative side I dicided that trying to
            <br>make a video game and all the visuals for it was a good and challenging
            <br>way to test my skills and knowledge. I did however want to keep some connection
            <br>with my main study, which is way I decided to create a racing game.

        <p>To create my game I decided to use Gamemaker Studio 2. This engine is a great
            <br>beginner friendly tool for creating 2D games. It has great support which allowed
            <br>me to find all the help I needed.

        <h2>Krita</h2>

        <p>To create the visuals for my game I decided to use Krita. This tool is an Image
            <br>manipulation program. As the name implies it allows for image manipulation
            <br>but additionally it is also a painting program. This combination of features
            <br>allowed me to create the cars in the game, which are based on real cars.
